CHD User Interface

Simple user interface for converting ISO or BIN/CUE image types that CHDMAN converts to CHD format.

Usage:

Drag your images unto the left pane and hit GO, right pane outputs info generated by CHDMAN for reference.

CHDUI also accepts a folders containing multiple images / folders with images as drag and drop and traverses through these folders looking for any ISO or BIN/CUE files it can find.

Output folder can be freely selected, but converted files get their own folder inside the selected folder, i.e.:

myimage.iso => c:\selectedfolder\myimage\myimage.chd
